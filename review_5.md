# Review 
## Interest of Content
Three sections, lot of information. \
Each of the sections provide good information, education even referring back to Blackboard Ultra. 

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
Style is consistent however lack of images except in the medical section. \
Lack of back button back to the index page. \
Good use of bullet points and headings, and also the boxes around the bullets. 

## Quality of written presentation
Simple, brief but informative which also provides links for readers to want to explore further. \
Link to sources is very good, allows the user to know where the facts came from and do their own research. 

## Validity of HTML
HTML is formatted fine, no comments however. \
Separate folders for each sub page allows for easier refactoring and separation (except education ?) 

## Evidence of collaboration
Commits are balanced around each user, credits are given on the index page. \
Each page has its own author and their GitHub linked at the bottom.
