          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6257447/">Computers have a wide range of use in the medical field.</a></p>

        <div id="Machine Learning">
          <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>Machine learning paradigms have many life-saving applications in medicine. Here are some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Computer vision has been used to better diagnose symptoms from visual sources
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this is the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522004280#:~:text=It%20has%20the%20ability%20to,of%20cancer%20detection%20and%20therapy">detection of cancerous cells</a></li>
                <li>This is generally more effective than manual analysis (done by a human professional), which is prone to inaccuracies and mistakes.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In addition to visual analysis, the statistical capabilities of machine learning enable analysis of symptom >
          </ul> 
        </div>

        <div id="Robotics">
          <h2>Robotics</h2>
          <p><a href="https://online-engineering.case.edu/blog/medical-robots-making-a-difference">Robotics has a huge breadth of possibility in the medical field</a> from helping people recover from debilitating diseases to assisting in operations themselves.
            <ul>
              <li>Surgical robots like the da Vinci enable surgeons to make much more precise movements that enable surgery that is less invasive. This offers recovery times and less mistakes in procedures.</li>
              <li>Disinfection robots like the Xenex provide hospitals with the ability to fully sterilise operating theaters and wards after use by using pulsed UV rays.</li>
              <li>Medical Delivery Drones enable the delivery of time-sensitive items like blood or plasma to be delivered to remote areas in a short amount of time, improving health outcomes particularly in rural areas. Companies like <a href="https://www.flyzipline.com/technology">Zipline</a> have been delivering blood and plasma to remote areas of the United States, Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and Kenya.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="Imaging">
          <h2>Medical Image Computing (MIC)</h2>
          <p>MIC is one field where computing has made a hugely positive contribution to the world. In the past, medical imaging was very limited in scope due to x-ray technology without computers only capable of 2D images. But through the power of computing, scans can now create 3D representations of the inside of someone's body allowing to carefully examine every miniscule detail and potentially find problems earlier and more accurately.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Records">
          <h2>Electronic Health Records</h2>
          <p>The digitisation of patient records has improved the availability of information available to doctors while massively increasing the data accessible on a macro scale for hospitals and health providers to be able to detect patterns in patients and provide cheaper and more effective preventative healthcare.</p>
